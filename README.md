# Project2
In this project I created a solar system in which each planet revolves around the sun seperately. 

I used different color codes for each planet and the sun. I used yellow colour for the Sun, red for Mars, blue for Earth and so on. In the beginning I made the sun with the help of turtle and kept it still in the centre. Then I created all the planets of the solar system with the help of turtles and just placed them at an equal footing from the middle turtle ('SUN'). Afterwards I just called a for loop and callled each turtle to make a revolution around the Sun.
